# Frontend Mentor - Four Card Feature Section

This is my solution to the [Four Card Feature Section challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/four-card-feature-section-weK1eFYK).  
It was built using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**. The goal was to create a responsive layout showcasing four feature cards in an attractive and accessible design.
